# Act One: Setup

### FADE IN:

**INT. ETHAN COLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

The dimly lit room is a chaotic mess, cluttered with stacks of old case files and empty bottles. ETHAN COLE, late 30s, rugged and weary, sits hunched over his desk, eyes scanning through the files with a haunted intensity. Flashbacks flicker on the wall opposite him, glimpses of a failed investigation that gnaw at his conscience.

**FLASHBACKS:**

- A crime scene, police tape fluttering in the wind.
- Ethan arguing with a superior, frustration etched into his features.
- A victim's face, lifeless and cold.

**BACK TO PRESENT:**

Ethan rubs his temples, pushing the memories aside, but their grip lingers.

**ETHAN**
(softly)
Not this time... not again.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. GRITTY NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY**

Ethan walks through a bustling street, his gaze taking in the worn faces and dilapidated buildings. The struggles of the people around him mirror his own internal battles. A flickering TV in a shop window catches his eye.

**INSERT - TV SCREEN:**

A NEWS REPORT shows VINCENT KANE, a powerful businessman, shaking hands at a lavish charity event, his smile polished and deceitful.

**ETHAN**
(to himself)
Kane... what are you hiding?

**CUT TO:**

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY**

Ethan meets DR. LILLIAN GRAVES, 40s, poised yet guarded. She watches him with a penetrating gaze.

**LILLIAN**
Ethan, you can't keep burying your past. It’s eating at you.

Ethan deflects, focusing on his coffee.

**ETHAN**
I'm fine, Lillian. Just working on something big.

Her eyes narrow, sensing more beneath his words.

**LILLIAN**
(concerned)
I've heard that before. You're not invincible, Ethan.

**ETHAN**
(irritated)
And I'm not broken, either.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. NEWSROOM - DAY**

Ethan stands before his EDITOR, 50s, skeptical and jaded.

**ETHAN**
I've got a lead on corporate corruption—Kane's company. It's big.

The editor leans back, weighing the risk.

**EDITOR**
Alright, but tread carefully. We can't afford another screw up.

Ethan nods, determination flaring.

**ETHAN**
This time, I'm getting it right.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT**

Ethan stands with MACK, a grizzled veteran cop, outside the precinct.

**MACK**
You're playing with fire, Cole. Kane's not just some businessman. People are dying.

Ethan's resolve hardens.

**ETHAN**
All the more reason to dig deeper.

**MACK**
(sighs)
Just watch your back. Not everyone gets a second chance.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. HACKER'S DEN - NIGHT**

Sophia Reyes, mid-20s, street-smart with a chip on her shoulder, types furiously at her computer. Ethan leans over her shoulder.

**SOPHIA**
You know, this ain't gonna be easy. Kane's got everything locked down tight.

Ethan smirks, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.

**ETHAN**
That's why I'm here. I need the best.

Sophia pauses, then nods, a silent agreement formed.

**SOPHIA**
(challenging)
You better be ready for what we find.

**ETHAN**
(grimly)
I always am.

**FADE OUT.**

# Act Two: Confrontation

  
**FADE IN:**  

**EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**  

Ethan and Sophia huddle in the shadows, the moonlight casting an eerie glow over the deserted lot. They peer through binoculars at a group of Kane's associates who gather under a flickering streetlamp. A briefcase exchanges hands.  

**SOPHIA**  
(whispering)  
Got it. That's the proof we need.  

Ethan nods, eyes locked on the scene, heart pounding. The thrill of uncovering the truth courses through him, but a shadow of doubt lingers in his eyes.  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. ETHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**  

Ethan sits hunched over his laptop, the room dimly lit by the screen's glow. He pours whiskey into a glass, the bottle nearly empty. As he edits the footage, his reflection wavers in the screen—haunted by past failures.  

**PHONE RINGS**  

He glances at the caller ID: Lillian. With a sigh, he silences the phone, ignoring her concern.  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT**  

Ethan confronts a WHISTLEBLOWER, a jittery figure with darting eyes.  

**ETHAN**  
(determined)  
What have you got for me?  

**WHISTLEBLOWER**  
I have information... but we need to be careful.  

Suddenly, headlights flash, and THUGS emerge, weapons ready. Ethan grabs the whistleblower, diving for cover as bullets ricochet off the brick walls.  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. MACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT**  

Mack sits across from Ethan, tension thick in the air.  

**MACK**  
You need to back off, Ethan. Kane isn't someone you can fight alone.  

Mack's expression shifts, revealing vulnerability.  

**MACK**  
(softly)  
He's family. This isn't just business.  

Ethan's resolve hardens, but Mack's warning lingers.  

**ETHAN**  
(defiant)  
Family or not, I'm not stopping. I can't.  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. SOPHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**  

Sophia pores over documents, connecting the dots between Kane and a string of murders. The evidence is damning.  

**SOPHIA**  
Ethan, we’re onto something big. But we’re not alone...  

Ethan glances around, paranoia creeping in. The feeling of being watched.  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. KANE'S OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT**  

Ethan and Sophia stake out from a nearby rooftop, cameras trained on the entrance. Security patrols the area, tension mounting.  

**ETHAN**  
We can't turn back now.  

Suddenly, SECURITY GUARDS spot them. A chase ensues, Ethan and Sophia racing down fire escapes, narrowly dodging capture.  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT**  

Breathless, Ethan stops, staring into the night.  

**ETHAN**  
(to himself)  
What am I doing?  

Sophia catches up, placing a hand on his shoulder.  

**SOPHIA**  
We’re in this together. But we need to be smart.  

Ethan nods, determination rekindled, yet doubt shadows his eyes.  

**FADE OUT.**  


# Act Three: Resolution

FADE IN:

INT. LILLIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The dimly lit room is filled with a heavy silence. ETHAN stands, fists clenched, facing LILLIAN. Shadows dance across the walls, reflecting the tension in the air.

ETHAN
(voice trembling)
Why didn't you tell me before? Why keep it a secret?

LILLIAN looks down, a mix of guilt and determination in her eyes.

LILLIAN
(softly)
I was trying to protect you, Ethan. But... you deserve the truth.

She hands him a folder. ETHAN opens it, eyes widening as he skims through the pages. The connection between his past case and KANE is undeniable.

Elegantly dressed guests mingle beneath opulent chandeliers. ETHAN, in a sharp suit, moves through the crowd with purpose, the folder clutched tightly in hand.

ETHAN
(to the crowd, voice steady)
Tonight, I reveal the truth about Kane Industries and the man behind it.

Gasps ripple through the audience. ETHAN holds up the folder, his evidence, for all to see.

ETHAN
(continuing)
Corruption, murder... it all leads back to Kane.

The room buzzes with shock and disbelief. KANE rises, attempting to regain control.

KANE
(loudly)
Lies! This is nothing but slander!

ETHAN remains unflinching, eyes locked with KANE's.

ETHAN
(firmly)
The evidence speaks for itself.

CUT TO:

INT. LILLIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ETHAN and LILLIAN sit together, the tension replaced by a quiet understanding.

ETHAN
(softly)
Thank you, Lillian. For everything.

LILLIAN smiles, a sense of relief washing over her.

LILLIAN
You're welcome, Ethan. You did what needed to be done.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAWN

ETHAN walks with newfound purpose, the early morning light casting a warm glow. He observes the bustling world around him, people starting their day, each with their own stories.

ETHAN
(V.O.)
(Reflecting)
The truth isn’t easy, but it’s necessary. It connects us, makes us stronger.

ETHAN takes a deep breath, ready to continue his work, now more connected and aware of his own vulnerabilities.

FADE OUT.
